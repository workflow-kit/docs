# Code Semantics Rules

Detect feature additions, refactors, and breaking changes.

## Rules

- `function-removed` — Functions/classes deleted (breaking change)
- `new-feature` — New files, "feat:" commits
- `non-functional-change` — Docs/text only
- `refactor` — Multiple renames, code restructuring
